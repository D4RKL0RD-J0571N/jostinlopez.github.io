**Creative Technologist · Systems Engineer · Generative AI Experimenter**

## Profile
I’m a self-taught creative technologist who builds systems where logic, art, and intelligence converge. I design modular runtime systems for games, build scalable backends and real-time workflows, and engineer local-first generative AI pipelines that prioritize reproducibility and customization. I ship prototypes and production tooling across Unity, FastAPI, and PyTorch—and I also produce creative work (2D illustration, audio, print design). I thrive on connecting research and practical engineering to create tools and experiences that empower creators.
